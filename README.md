#### • The aim of this repository is to build highly-interpretable and highly-accurate machine learning models that balance between variance, bias, and time complexity :bulb:
#### • Most of the time, Scikit-Learn framework is being used to build ML models and Keras for DL. I hope you find these notebooks useful :smile:

#### • The repository contains hands-on labs of 6 machine learning courses created by IBM. These courses cover in depth and breadth numerous ML concepts, and they are ordered as follows,

01 - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/01%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)

02 - [Supervised Machine Learning [Regression]](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/02%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BRegression%5D)

03 - [Supervised Machine Learning [Classification]](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/03%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BClassification%5D)

04 - [Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/04%20-%20Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning)

05 - [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/05%20-%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning)
