### Welcome to my IBM—ML Repository :smile:

#### • The aim of this repository is to build highly-interpretable and highly-accurate machine learning models that balance between variance, bias, and time complexity :bulb:
#### • Most of the time, Scikit-Learn framework is being used to build these models. I hope you find these notebooks useful :smile:
#### • The repository contains hands-on labs of 6 machine learning courses created by IBM. These courses cover in depths and breadth many exciting ML concepts, and they are ordered are as follows,

01 - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/01%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)

02 - [Supervised Machine Learning [Regression]](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/02%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BRegression%5D)

03 - [Supervised Machine Learning [Classification]](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/03%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BClassification%5D)

04 - [Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/tree/main/04%20-%20Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning)

#### • You are welcome to explore my findings in the capstone projects, which I created during my learning journey, as below,

Capstone Project A - [Treatment Costs per Person - Exploratory & Predictive Analysis
](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/01%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/F%20-%20Treatment%20Costs%20per%20Person%20-%20Exploratory%20%26%20Predictive%20Analysis.ipynb)

Capstone Project B - [Forecasting Photovoltaic Generated Power - Regression Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/02%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BRegression%5D/F%20-%20Forecasting%20Photovoltaic%20Generated%20Power.ipynb)

Capstone Project C - [Fault Classification in Photovoltaic Plants - Multiclassification Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/03%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BClassification%5D/J%20-%20Fault%20Classification%20in%20Photovoltaic%20Plants.ipynb)

Capstone Project D - [Date Fruit Segmentation & Dimensionality Reduction via PCA](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/04%20-%20Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning/F%20-%20Date%20Fruit%20Segmentation%20%26%20Dimensionality%20Reduction%20via%20PCA.ipynb)
