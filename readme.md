The aim of this repository is to build highly-interpretable and highly-accurate machine learning models that balance between variance, bias, and time complexity. Scikit-Learn framework is being used to build machine learning models and Keras for deep learning :bulb:

## Capstone Projects
You are welcome to explore my findings in my personal capstone projects that I created during my learning journey.

#### A - [Treatment Costs per Person - Exploratory & Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/01%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/F%20-%20Treatment%20Costs%20per%20Person%20-%20Exploratory%20%26%20Predictive%20Analysis.ipynb)

• The purpose of this project is to predict the cost of medical treatments based on six features, namely, age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region.

• An in-Depth EDA is conducted via pair, bar, box, violin, regression plot to see the effect of smoking on charges.

• A hypothesis testing is conducted on the relationship between treatment costs above 35K $ and smoking status. It indicates that a person with 35K $ charges is most-likely a smoker with a p-value = 0.023 and a confidence level of 0.977.

#### B - [Forecasting Photovoltaic Generated Power - Regression Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/02%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BRegression%5D/F%20-%20Forecasting%20Photovoltaic%20Generated%20Power.ipynb)

• The aim of this project is to create a regression model that predicts the power generated by PV panels to facilitate energy management in power plants. 

• An ML pipeline that encompasses polynomial transformation, standard scaling, and regressor models is deployed.

• A GridSearchCV & hyper-parameters tuning of the models is concducted.

• Benchmarking of Regular, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net & Gradient Boosting Regressors. Winner is the Gradient Boosting Regressor model with an R2 score of ~ 0.79.


#### C - [Fault Classification in Photovoltaic Plants - Multiclassification Analysis](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/03%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20%5BClassification%5D/J%20-%20Fault%20Classification%20in%20Photovoltaic%20Plants.ipynb)

#### D - [Date Fruit Segmentation & Dimensionality Reduction via PCA](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/04%20-%20Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning/F%20-%20Date%20Fruit%20Segmentation%20%26%20Dimensionality%20Reduction%20via%20PCA.ipynb)

#### E -  [MRI Brain Tumor Classification via CNN](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/IBM_MachineLearning/blob/main/05%20-%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning/J%20-%20MRI%20Brain%20Tumor%20Classification%20via%20CNN.ipynb)
